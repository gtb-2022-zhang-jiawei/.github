## About me
---
Hi,everyone! My name is `Jiawei Zhang`, and Iâ€™m a recent smart city graduate from UCL. This is my really first time writing markdown file, believe me I tried so hard!! 

I had some basic programming knowledge back in college, however working as a programmer is definitely a huge challenge to me. I'm appreciated that thoughtworks values employees' personal skill and provides chances for us to advance skill.
